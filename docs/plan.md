# Planned Features

## New Features

### High Impact

#### 1. Recurring transaction scheduling
- Detection exists (groups by amount+category+merchant, calculates frequency/confidence) but users can't *create* scheduled recurring transactions
- Add ability to mark a transaction as recurring with frequency (weekly/biweekly/monthly/yearly)
- Show upcoming scheduled transactions on the home screen
- Option to auto-create or prompt for confirmation when due

#### 2. Transaction templates / Quick Add
- Save frequently used transactions as templates (amount, category, account, merchant pre-filled)
- Quick-add from home screen or FAB long-press
- "Use as template" option when viewing an existing transaction

### Medium Impact

#### 3. Tags / Labels on transactions
- Flexible tagging beyond the single-category system
- Examples: "vacation", "tax-deductible", "shared-expense"
- Filter and analyze by tag across categories
- Multi-select tags per transaction

## UX Polish

### Medium Impact

#### 4. Undo for more actions
- Currently only transaction delete has undo
- Add undo for: account delete, category delete, bulk operations
- Use the existing notification system's action button

### Nice to Have

#### 5. Home screen customization
- Settings for section toggles exist — add drag-to-reorder sections
- Let users arrange: accounts, balance, quick actions, recent transactions in any order

#### 6. Dark/Light theme toggle
- Currently dark-only
- Some users prefer light mode, especially outdoors
- The color intensity system could map to light mode variants
